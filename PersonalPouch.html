                    <p> The <a href="https://hearthookhome.com/personal-pouch-free-crochet-pouch-pattern/"> <strong>Personal Pouch</strong> </a> is a design from Heart Hook Home, written by Ashlea in 2021. The instructions were clear with plenty of helpful photos throughout the article. <br></br>
                        This was a fun project that took around 3-4 hours to complete. I didn’t have enough of a yarn that I wanted to use to create this piece as one colour, so I used several colours, which turned out quite nice. The overlapping blues are nice, and the darker blue backing helps pop out the light-coloured triangles on the front. <br></br>
                        Since you make four triangles, after the first triangle, it’s easy to just follow the pattern, as it is repetitive. The square is also pretty easy to create. The only bit that I struggled with was connecting all the layers together. <br></br>
                        One fun element of this pouch is the shutter-like opening. The triangles used help create this effect, which was very satisfying at the end. <br></br> <img src="./resources/CSS/images/Personal Pouch 2.jpg"> <br></br>
                        It also came out larger than what I expected, but I think that was because I was using a thicker yarn and hook then in the original. <br></br>
                        Overall, I would definitely recommend this pattern to anyone looking for a fun, new, and creative pouch, or are just looking for a smaller project with a repetitive design. Enjoy crafting!
