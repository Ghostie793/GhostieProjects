                    <p> This pouch is an elegant choice with a simple build up into a beautiful cable stitch. From Draiguna, the <a href="https://www.draiguna.com/2018/03/reagent-pouches.html"><strong>Reagent Pouch</strong></a> is a wonderful project to make, either for yourself or as a gift to dice-loving friends!<br></br>
                        I was working with limited yarn on this project, so I stopped half way on the sides of the pouch, making it smaller. However, the desired pattern can still be seen (despite the bad camera quality. Sorry about that!). This was my first time learning the cable stitch, so I’m quite happy with how it turned out. <br></br>
                        <img src="./resources/CSS/images/Reagent Pouches (2).jpg"><br></br>
                        The way that the pouch closes is also simple yet beautiful, in elegant drawstrings tied in a bow. I unfortunately miscounted on my chain, making them slightly uneven, but with a few tweaks, it wasn’t too noticeable. <br></br>
                        Draiguna added charms to the original pouch, which adds to the regal charm of the pouch. I would absolutely recommend doing something similar, or you could do what I did and simply let the pouch do it all.<br></br>
                        The pattern is also relatively easy to follow, with helpful annotated pictures along the way. The text chosen to annotate the pictures is a bit looping, but arrows do help clarify anything, along with the instructions.<br></br>
                        Enjoy crafting!
