                    <p> These <a href="https://leftinknots.com/home/crochet-perfect-fit-mitten/"><strong> Blue Mittens </strong></a>are a much older pattern that I did. A good beginner project, it’s simple and easy to follow. <br></br>
                        I found this project when I was looking for simple gift ideas. It was going into the colder seasons at the time, so I decided that it was perfect. <br></br>
                        The person I was making the mittens for had smaller hands than the pattern was made for, so I had to adjust the pattern. This did cause the mittens to be a bit uneven in size, but it wasn’t too noticeable. <br></br>
                        There also was a similar beanie pattern, and that was a joy to make as well. I'll make sure to mention this in another article. <br></br>
                        Enjoy crafting! <br></br>
